# pa11ycrawler ignore rules
#
# In YAML, you can use a "folded style" to break up a long string
# over multiple lines, without inserting newlines in your string.
# You can do this by starting your string with a ">" character,
# and then indenting your string on the next line. By default,
# this will cause your string to end with a newline character -- to strip that
# off, add a "-" after the ">". This is called the "block chomping indicator".
